Approach/Pseudocode behind "Duck, Duck, Goose?":

Take game g as input

Take question q and number of lies n as input
Take all asked question and answer as input then store it all in an array

For every possible "P" combination of all 10 places:
	check "P" against all the rules (question and answer) and count number of lies
	if number of lies = expected lies:
		add combination "P" in answer
print answer
