There are four solutions that you will want to produce.

1) Create a top-down solution without memoization, and submit it.   

Question 1: What is it about this problem that prevents this solution from passing all of the sample test cases?

 

2) Add memoization to the top-down solution, and submit it.

Question 2:  If you are getting a "Wrong Answer", it is likely that you are running out of a resource.  What resource might that be?

 

3) Create a bottom-up solution, which stores the same number of values as the top-down approach (up to constant factors), and submit it.

Question 3: Which solution the bottom-up one, or the top-down one is faster? Why is this the case?

 

4) Create a bottom-up solution that uses O(1) space, and submit it.

Question 4: What is the time complexity of your top-down solution with memoization, your first bottom-up solution, and your second bottom up solution?

 

Submit the following:

a) Your HackerRank id.

b) Your four java source code files.

c) Answers to the four questions above.
